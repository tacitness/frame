X11 display server written in x86_64 Linux assembly. No libc, no
toolkits, no FreeType, no Mesa, no Xlib. Just NASM source, direct
syscalls, the X11 wire protocol on a Unix socket, and the kernel's
DRM/KMS + evdev interfaces.

Long-range goal: serve enough of the X11 wire protocol (core + SHAPE +
RENDER + XKB + COMPOSITE + DAMAGE + RANDR + MIT-SHM + XInput2 + XVideo) to host
the whole [CHasm](https://github.com/isene/chasm) desktop plus
arbitrary X clients — Firefox, VS Code, GIMP, Inkscape — all
software-rendered, all on a stack written end-to-end in asm.

> **Security status:** frame is experimental. Its Unix X11 socket is owner-only
> (`0700`); setup authentication fields are not yet validated. Run clients as
> the same unprivileged uid and do not treat it as a cross-user boundary; see
> [Security](SECURITY.md).

*The whole stack, end to end in assembly: [pointer](https://github.com/isene/pointer)
(a Rust TUI file manager) running inside [glass](https://github.com/isene/glass)
(the asm terminal) on **frame** (the asm X server), shown on the laptop's
panel via DRM/KMS — two-pane layout, syntax-highlighted preview, colour,
keyboard-driven. No libc, no Xlib, no Mesa anywhere in the path.*

Phase 4 is the "tile runs on frame" milestone — self-hosting CHasm.
Phase 14 is the "Firefox runs on a 50k-line asm X server" milestone.

## Phase 1: what works

```bash
make
./frame 7 --noinput     # safe headless server on display :7
DISPLAY=:7 xdpyinfo     # connects, gets setup reply, sends QueryExtension
```

`frame` accepts an X11 client, validates its 12-byte connection-setup
request (byte-order `l`, protocol 11.0, drains any auth tail), and
emits a structurally valid setup reply describing:

- One screen, 1920×1080, root window XID `0x80`
- Two depths: 24 (TrueColor RGB) and 32 (TrueColor ARGB for glass
  transparency)
- One pixmap format (depth 24 in 32 bpp)

Core and extension requests listed in the roadmap dispatch to the current
handlers. Unsupported requests are logged; reply-bearing support must be
validated before it is considered compatible. The protocol test plan lives in
[docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).

## Phase 2: DRM/KMS probe

```bash
./frame --probe
```

Opens `/dev/dri/cardN`, enumerates resources, lists connectors:

```
frame: opened /dev/dri/card1, driver i915 v1.6.0
frame: resources: 4 CRTCs, 5 connectors, 21 encoders
frame: framebuffer range 0x0 to 16384x16384
  connector 507: eDP-1 → connected, 1 modes, preferred 1920x1200 @ 120 Hz
  connector 516: DisplayPort-1 → disconnected, 0 modes
  ...
```

Uses three read-only ioctls — `DRM_IOCTL_VERSION`,
`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETRESOURCES`, `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETCONNECTOR`. None
require DRM master, so this runs safely alongside an active Xorg.

## Phase 2b: DRM/KMS modeset

```bash
sudo ./frame --modeset
```

Pure-asm path: takes DRM master, picks the first connected
connector, queries its preferred mode, allocates a dumb buffer
(`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB`), mmap's it (`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_MAP_DUMB`
+ `mmap`), fills it solid purple, binds it as a framebuffer
(`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ADDFB`), and points the CRTC at it
(`DRM_IOCTL_MODE_SETCRTC`). Holds the picture for 5 seconds, then
restores the CRTC's prior state and frees everything in reverse.

### Test recipe

Needs DRM master, which Xorg holds while it's running. From a TTY,
after stopping the display manager:

```bash
# 1. Switch to a TTY
Ctrl+Alt+F2

# 2. Login as geir, navigate to the repo
cd ~/Main/G/GIT-isene/frame

# 3. Stop X (whichever applies — pick one)
sudo systemctl stop sddm           # if KDE plasma
sudo systemctl stop gdm            # if GNOME
sudo systemctl stop lightdm        # if XFCE/MATE
# or, if X was started manually from this TTY, just kill it

# 4. Run the modeset
sudo ./frame --modeset

# 5. Wait ~5 seconds, screen turns solid purple, then restores

# 6. Restart your session
sudo systemctl start sddm      # or however you start
```

Expected stderr:

```
frame: opened /dev/dri/card1
frame: SET_MASTER OK
frame: resources: 4 CRTCs, 5 connectors, 21 encoders
frame: framebuffer range 0x0 to 16384x16384
frame: using connector 507 on CRTC 79, mode 1920x1200
frame: created dumb buffer, 9216000 bytes
frame: filled with purple
frame: added framebuffer 84
frame: SETCRTC OK — displaying for 5 seconds
frame: restored original CRTC, cleanup done
```

The seconds in between are the proof: a CHasm asm binary putting
pixels on the physical panel through nothing but raw DRM ioctls. No
libdrm, no Mesa, no display server — just frame talking directly to
the kernel through the same ABI Xorg uses.

### Safety

The full cleanup path always runs (RMFB → munmap → DESTROY_DUMB →
DROP_MASTER → close), and the CRTC is restored to its prior state.
Worst case if something goes wrong: the screen stays purple until
the kernel reprograms it (the next X start does this).

## Phase 3: evdev input

```bash
./frame --probe-input                       # enumerate /dev/input/event*
./frame --watch-input /dev/input/event3     # live decode events
```

`--probe-input` scans `/dev/input/event0..31`, opens each one read-only,
calls `EVIOCGNAME` (=`_IOC(_IOC_READ, 'E', 0x06, 64)`), and lists what
came back:

```
frame: input devices:
  event0: Power Button
  event1: Lid Switch
  event3: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard
  event5: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad
  event7: SHK Bluetooth (Touch)
  ...
```

`--watch-input PATH` opens the named device and decodes each
`input_event` record (24 bytes: `tv_sec`, `tv_usec`, `type`, `code`,
`value`). Output line format is one of:

```
KEY 30 press        # keyboard: 'A' down
KEY 30 release      # 'A' up
BTN 272 press       # mouse: BTN_LEFT down
REL 0 value=-3      # mouse moved 3 left
REL 1 value=2       # mouse moved 2 down
ABS 0 value=512     # touchpad position
SW  0 value=1       # switch (lid open/close, etc.)
```

Keycodes match `/usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h`. Phase 4
layers the evdev→XKB→keysym translation on top so X clients see
real keysyms.

### Access

`/dev/input/event*` is `crw-rw---- root:input` on most distros. Either
`sudo`, or `sudo usermod -aG input geir && reboot`. From a VT (where
phase 2b runs anyway) this is automatic if you use `sudo`.

### Config (`~/.framerc`)

frame reads an optional `~/.framerc` (line-based `key = value`, the CHasm
rc convention):

```
keymap = no                # keyboard layout: us (default) or no (Norwegian)
sensitivity = 75           # pointer speed, percent of raw (default 100)
dwt = 400                  # ms the touchpad ignores motion+taps after a keystroke (0 = off)
nightlight = 60            # Mod4+n warmth strength 0..100 (default 60)
sunlight = 40              # Mod4+b contrast strength 0..100 (default 40)
shake_find = 1             # wiggle the pointer to briefly enlarge it (0 = off)
magnify = 2               # Mod4+z magnifier lens zoom factor 2..8 (default 2)
cursor_color = ffffff      # cursor fill colour, RRGGBB hex (default ffffff)
cursor_transparency = 50   # cursor % transparent: 0 solid .. 100 invisible (default 50)
cursor_accent = 00c800     # arrow fill over pressable items, RRGGBB (default green)
background = ~/.framebg    # desktop wallpaper: a raw BGRX file at panel res
blank_timeout = 600        # idle seconds before the panel powers off (0 = never)
blank_key = Mod4+Escape    # hotkey that powers the panel off NOW (none = off)
```

`keymap`: `us` (the default, or no file) is the standard US layout. `no`
is Norwegian: `Shift+6` = `&`, the `ø æ å` keys, `< >` on the ISO key left
of `Z`, Norwegian punctuation, and **AltGr** (right Alt = ISO_Level3_Shift
= Mod5) for `@ £ $ { } [ ] \ € ~`. Delivered to clients via
`GetKeyboardMapping` (6 keysyms/keycode, AltGr at level 3), so any X
client (glass, xterm, …) picks it up.

`sensitivity`: scales pointer motion (touchpad + mouse) by this percent.
`100` is raw 1:1; lower values slow the cursor for finer control.

`dwt` (disable-while-typing / palm rejection): after any non-modifier
keystroke the touchpad ignores motion and taps for this many ms, and a
touch that *begins* inside that window stays ignored until the finger
lifts — a palm resting on the pad can't steer or click, even after you
stop typing. Modifier-only presses (Ctrl+click, Mod4+drag) don't mute,
and physical clickpad button presses always work. `0` disables.

`nightlight` / `sunlight`: colour-temperature presets applied through the
CRTC gamma LUT — one ioctl at scanout, zero per-pixel CPU. **`Mod4+n`**
toggles night-light (warms the screen: blue and green pulled down by the
`nightlight` strength); **`Mod4+b`** toggles sunlight mode (steepens
contrast by the `sunlight` strength for reading in bright light). Press the
same combo again to return to normal. Both strengths are `0..100`.

`shake_find`: wiggle the pointer quickly left-right and the arrow briefly
grows (3x), so a lost cursor is easy to spot, then shrinks back on its own.
Pure gesture, no key. Detection is a few compares per motion event and
nothing at all when idle. `0` disables.

`magnify` / **`Mod4+z`**: a magnifier lens that follows the cursor,
showing the area under it enlarged by the `magnify` factor (2..8). Toggle
again to hide. It's drawn as a compositor overlay — moving it just damages
the old and new rects, so the desktop under it restores for free with no
backing store. Runs only while the lens is up; off costs one compare.

`cursor_color` / `cursor_transparency`: the arrow's interior fill and how
see-through it is. The black outline is always kept for contrast. Colour
is `RRGGBB` hex; transparency `0` is solid, `100` fully invisible. Free
alpha — the DRM cursor plane blends it in hardware.

`cursor_accent`: apps set a "hand" cursor over links and buttons; frame
shows the same arrow with this fill instead of swapping shapes. Text
fields get a real I-beam, `scrot -s` a crosshair, and the pointer hides
while you type (the blank cursor). All sprite swaps happen only on
crossings — zero idle cost. Sessions should export `XCURSOR_CORE=1` so
toolkits ask for classic cursor-font glyphs frame can classify.

`blank_timeout`: screen auto-off, like `xset dpms` on Xorg. After this many
seconds without keyboard/mouse/touchpad input the compositor disables the
CRTC — the display engine and eDP panel power down completely. Any input
wakes it back up with a full repaint. Battery-tight by design: frame wakes
exactly once at the deadline (the idle poll timeout IS the deadline), and
while dark it sleeps indefinitely, swallowing client redraws. Default 600
(10 minutes); `0` disables.

`blank_key`: blank the panel immediately, without waiting for the timeout.
Modifiers (`Shift`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`/`Mod1`, `Super`/`Mod4`, `Mod5`) joined
with `+`, ending in a keysym name (same names as the `keycode` remap
lines). Handled server-side like the Ctrl+Alt+Fn VT switch, so it works
regardless of focus or grabs and the combo never reaches clients. Any
key press or pointer motion re-lights the panel. Default `Mod4+Escape`;
`none` disables.

`background`: a desktop wallpaper, drawn natively by the compositor (no feh,
no root-pixmap). frame carries no image decoder, so the value points at a
**raw BGRX buffer at panel resolution** (`screen_w * screen_h * 4` bytes),
not a PNG/JPEG. The `chasm-bg <image>` helper (ships with
[bolt](https://github.com/isene/bolt)) pre-renders any image to `~/.framebg`
at the panel size — plus the bolt locker's `~/.lockbg.rgb` — and adds this
line for you. Decode happens once, offline; frame just mmaps the buffer and
blits it. A wrong-sized file is ignored (falls back to the solid colour).

## External displays

frame drives a second connected output natively: one wide framebuffer
spans both screens side by side (panel left, external right), each CRTC
scans its own slice via the SETCRTC pan offset, and page flips go to
both. RandR reports two monitors ("default" + "ext"), so tile pins
WS 10 to the external out of the box and `xrandr --listmonitors` shows
both. Hotplug is event-driven: a netlink uevent socket sits in the
serve loop's poll set (zero idle cost); plugging or unplugging a
display rebuilds the framebuffers at the new combined size, reprograms
the CRTCs and sends RRScreenChangeNotify so tile rediscovers and
retiles. `./frame N --fbtest2` fakes a second 1920x1080 output for
headless dual-head testing.

Note: with two outputs the `background` file no longer matches the
framebuffer size and is ignored (solid colour fallback) — re-render it
at the combined resolution if wallpaper-on-dual matters.

## How it's built

Pure NASM, no libc, single static ELF. Following CHasm conventions:

```bash
make
make quality
```

State is BSS-allocated (no malloc). Per-client connection state lives
in fixed slots with disjoint resource-ID bands and centralized cleanup.

## Development and delivery

The repository includes hardware-free unit, ELF/static, live protocol,
regression, malformed-input, and reproducibility suites; versioned local hooks;
hosted read-only CI; mandatory git-secrets plus Gitleaks protection; opt-in
isolated self-hosted scanners; SonarQube external NASM policy; and
signed-provenance release packaging.

```bash
make install-hooks       # enable versioned commit/push checks
make quality             # canonical read-only developer gate
make ci-local            # quality plus local security checks
make bench-protocol      # informational headless latency benchmark
```
